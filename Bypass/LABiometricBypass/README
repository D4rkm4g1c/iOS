LABiometricBypass
LABiometricBypass is a Frida script designed to bypass biometric and passcode authentication prompts in iOS/macOS apps using the LocalAuthentication framework.

Features
Hooks and overrides canEvaluatePolicy:error: to always indicate authentication is available

Hooks evaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply: to automatically return a successful authentication result

Works on apps using Objective-C runtime and the standard LocalAuthentication APIs

Logs calls and bypass actions for monitoring during runtime

Usage
Install Frida on your computer and target device.

Save the script as LABiometricBypass.js.

Connect your jailbroken iOS/macOS device with Frida server running.

Start the target app with Frida:
frida -U -f <bundle_id_or_process> -l LABiometricBypass.js
Watch the console output for confirmation logs indicating the bypass hooks are active.

Example Output
Spawning `com.example.app`...                                  
[+] Frida biometric/passcode bypass hooks installed.
Spawned `com.example.app`. Resuming main thread!               
[iPhone::com.example.app ]-> [*] canEvaluatePolicy called with policy: 2
[*] Bypassing canEvaluatePolicy – returning YES



How It Works
Uses Frida’s Objective-C API to hook key LAContext methods from the LocalAuthentication framework.

Forces canEvaluatePolicy:error: to always return true, indicating biometrics/passcode is available.

Overrides the callback in evaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply: to immediately invoke success without user interaction.

Suitable for apps relying on the standard iOS/macOS biometric and passcode API calls.

Limitations
Requires the target app to use Objective-C runtime (not pure Swift without ObjC bridging).

Does not bypass custom biometric/passcode implementations outside LocalAuthentication framework.

May not work on apps with advanced anti-tampering or runtime protection.
