# JailMonkeyEraser

**JailMonkeyEraser** is a Frida script for iOS that bypasses jailbreak and dynamic instrumentation detection in apps using the popular JailMonkey, DetectFrida, and JailBrokenHelper libraries.

## Features

- Hooks and overrides all major JailMonkey jailbreak detection methods
- Bypasses DetectFrida checks for Frida instrumentation
- Disables custom jailbreak checks in JailBrokenHelper
- Prints log messages for each bypassed method

## Usage

1. **Install Frida** on your computer and device.
2. **Save the script** as `jailmonkeyeraser.js`.
3. **Connect your jailbroken iOS device** and ensure Frida server is running.
4. **Launch the target app with Frida:**

   ```sh
   frida -U -f <bundle_id> -l jailmonkeyeraser.js
   ```

   Replace `<bundle_id>` with the appâ€™s bundle identifier (e.g., `com.example.app`).

5. **Observe the logs** for `[Bypass]` messages confirming the hooks are active.

## Example Output
Spawning `com.example.app`...                                  
Jailbreak/Frida detection bypass hooks installed!
Spawned `com.example.app`. Resuming main thread!               
[iPhone::com.example.app ]-> [Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.hasCydiaInstalled() -> false
[Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.hasUndecimusInstalled() -> false
[Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.hasSileoInstalled() -> false
[Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.hasZbraInstalled() -> false
[Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.isContainsSuspiciousApps() -> false
[Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.checkDYLD() -> false
[Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.checkSuspiciousObjCClasses() -> false
[Bypass] JailBrokenHelper.canEditSystemFiles() -> false


## How It Works

- Hooks Objective-C methods in JailMonkey, DetectFrida, and JailBrokenHelper.
- Forces all jailbreak and Frida detection checks to return `false` (not jailbroken, not instrumented).
- Allows full app functionality on jailbroken and instrumented devices.
